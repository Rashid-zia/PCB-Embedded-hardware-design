# 3W Audio Amplifier – PCB Design and Layout (EAGLE)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and PCB layout of a 3W audio amplifier, developed as part of my bachelor studies in Applied Informatics in Industrial Automation. The goal was to design a compact, manufacturable, and reliable double-sided PCB, including schematic design, component selection, custom footprint creation, and layout optimization using Autodesk EAGLE.

This project strengthened my practical understanding of analog electronics, PCB design principles, and hardware implementation workflows, which are essential skills in robotics and embedded systems engineering.
